N.O.W. stands for Network of Women. This is an initiative by ThoughtWorks, and is a growing and connected community of women. ThoughtWorks N.O.W. is a forum for curious women from all walks of life, looking to be part of an open and inclusive network, to come together to learn from each other and be inspired. It provides a positive and motivating environment by bringing fresh content, wonderful speakers and trainers, and innovative formats.

N.O.W. brings together women from the entrepreneurial to the curious, ambitious and successful leaders. They have a passionate enthusiasm for sharing their choices, their journeys, successes and failures with the larger community of women. And this is the reason for N.O.W. to exist.
